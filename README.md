# brew-cask-upgrade

`brew-cask-upgrade` is a command-line tool for upgrading every outdated apps
installed by [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io).

Homebrew Cask extends [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and brings its elegance,
simplicity, and speed to OS X applications and large binaries alike, but it
lacks a sub-command like `brew upgrade` for upgrading installed apps, so if you want to upgrade the installed apps, you have to delete the previous versions and re-install the latest version manually for every single app.

With `brew-cask-upgrade`, you just need to type one command to upgrade all the apps installed by Homebrew Cask.

## Installation

```
gem install brew-cask-upgrade
```

## Usage

```
brew-cask-upgrade
```
